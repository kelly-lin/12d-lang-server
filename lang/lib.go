Important note: All Boxes, even through they have names like Real_Box and Input_Box,derived from Widgets and can be used in many options that take a Widget.  For exampleShow_widget.  However for the array of widgets column_widgets[ ] defining the GridCtrl_Boxcolumns, the array values need to be Widget and so the other types derived from Widget have tobe cast to a Widget before they can be used to fill the column_widgets[] array.  The cast is easilydone by simply having the following cast function defined and in your macro code. Widget cast(Widget w){return w;}See 5. 61. 14 GridCtrl_Boxfor an example of using cast when defining values forcolumn_widgets[].

The Plot_Parameter_File is a 12d Model Variable that can contain plot parameters and the plotparameter values for a given plot type. Plot_Parameter_File TypesThe valid Plot_Parameter_File types are:section_x_plotsection_long_plotmelb_water_sewer_long_plotpipeline_long_plotdrainage_long_plotdrainage_plan_plotplot_frame_plotrainfall_methodsdesign_parametersEach type of plot has its own set of valid plot parameters. When a Plot_Parameter_File, say ppf, is first defined, it starts as an empty structure until it hasits type defined using the Create_XX_parameter calls.  The ppf then knows what plot parametersare valid for that type of plot. The Plot_Parameter_File ppf is then loaded with particular plot parameters and their values bymaking Set_Parameter calls and/or reading in data from a plot parameter file stored already disk(Read_Parameter_File). When all the required plot parameters have been set, the Plot_Parameter_File ppf can be usedto create a plot (Plot_parameter_file). The Plot_Parameter_File ppf can also be written out as a disk file so that it can be used in thefuture (Write_parameter_file). Note: note all the available parameters for a particular plot type need to be set for aPlot_Parameter_File.  For most plot parameters, there is a default value used for plotting and thatis used if the parameter is not given a value by a Set_Parameter call. Create_parameter_file(Plot_Parameter_File ppf,Text ppf_type)Set the Plot_Parameter_File ppf to be of type ppf_type and clear out any information alreadycontained in ppf.  For the valid types, see Plot_Parameter_File Types. Hence if ppf already contained plot information, then all that information will be lost.

This is necessary if the number of points in the string is greater than the size of the arraysavailable to contain the information. As in the previous function, the maximum number of points that can be returned is given bymax_pts (usually the size of the arrays). However, for this function, the point data returned starts at point number start_pt rather thanpoint one. The (x,y,z) values at each string point are returned in the Real arrays x[], y[] and z[]. The actual number of points returned is given by Integer num_ptsPage 832Strings Replaced by Super Strings\u000cChapter 5 12dPL Library Callsnum_pts \u003c= max_ptsIf the Element elt is not of type pipe, then num_pts is set to zero and the function return value isset to a non-zero value. A function return value of zero indicates the data was successfully returned. NoteA start_pt of one gives the same result as for the previous function. Set_pipe_data(Element elt,Real x[],Real y[],Real z[],Integer num_pts,Integerstart_pt)For the pipe Element elt, set the (x,y,z) data for num_pts points, starting at point numberstart_pt. This function allows the user to modify a large number of points of the string in one call starting atpoint number start_pt rather than point one. The maximum number of points that can be set is given by the difference between the number ofpoints in the string and the value of start_pt. The (x,y,z) values for the string points are given in the Real arrays x[], y[] and z[]. The number of the first string point to be modified is start_pt. The total number of points to be set is given by Integer num_ptsIf the Element elt is not of type pipe, then nothing is modified and the function return value is setto a non-zero value. A function return value of zero indicates the data was successfully set. Notes(a) A start_pt of one gives the same result as the previous function.

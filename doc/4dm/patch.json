If the first attribute called att_name does exist and it is type Text, then set its value to att. If the attribute exists and is not of type Text, then a non-zero return value is returned. A function return value of zero indicates the attribute value is successfully set. Note - the Get_attribute_type call can be used to get the type of the attribute called att_name."
